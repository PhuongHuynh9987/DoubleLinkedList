# DoubleLinkedList
This is part of my Intro to Data Structure and Algorithm class assignments in which we need to create a linked list with double nodes.
Each node will point to prevNode and nextNode. 
Then call the functions to add an node at beginning, at the end, remove a node before, after, or insert a node before, or after. 
The algorithm uses doubleNode nested class to build doubly linked list.
